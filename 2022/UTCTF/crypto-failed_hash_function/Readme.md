> I made this keyed hash function for my final project, but I got a 0... Apparently, there's too many collisions and you can recover the key after one hash. I don't believe it. In fact, if you can break my hash function 100 times, I'll give you a flag! I'll even be nice -- you get two whole guesses to find the key. By oops (@oops on discord)
